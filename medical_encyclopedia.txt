Influenza (Flu)
Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses.

Common symptoms of flu include:
- Fever or feeling feverish/chills (not everyone with flu will have a fever)
- Cough
- Sore throat
- Runny or stuffy nose
- Muscle or body aches
- Headaches
- Fatigue (tiredness)
- Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults

The flu typically comes on suddenly and symptoms are usually more severe than the common cold.
Most people recover within a few days to less than two weeks. Treatment includes rest, fluids,
and over-the-counter medications. Antiviral drugs may be prescribed in some cases.

Strep Throat
Strep throat is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria. It primarily
affects the throat and tonsils and is highly contagious.

Symptoms of strep throat include:
- Sudden, severe sore throat
- Pain when swallowing

- Tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth
- Swollen, tender lymph nodes in the neck
- Fever (101°F or higher)

Unlike viral sore throats, strep throat typically does not cause cough or runny nose.
It requires antibiotic treatment to prevent complications. A throat swab test confirms diagnosis.

Asthma
Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition where airways become inflamed and narrowed,
making breathing difficult. It can range from mild to severe and life-threatening.

Symptoms of asthma include:
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness or pain
- Wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing)
- Coughing, especially at night or early morning
- Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing
- Trouble sleeping due to breathing problems
- Fatigue during physical activity

Asthma symptoms can be triggered by allergens, exercise, cold air, stress, or respiratory
infections. Treatment includes avoiding triggers, using inhaled medications (bronchodilators
and corticosteroids), and having an asthma action plan.
